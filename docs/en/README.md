## Getting started

Sketchware was made to be as user friendly as possible. Even if you didn't write any code before, you can create your first android app in just a few minutes.

## What's scratch

Scratch is open source project for making simple animations and programs. You can find more at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).

## Prerequisites

There are just a few things to get started:
- **Get friendly with scratch** as sketchware is platform to build and share your apps, it's important to know what are you using to make your apps. Open scratch in your pc web browser and try to make a simple animation (trust me, you'll learn a lot). Then, go back here and start making *real* apps for android!
- **Sketchware** sketchware is needed to be installed on your device to build your apps. Once your app is packaged (you'll learn what that means later), you can share your app anywhere (and others can try it even if they don't have sketchware)

## Next steps

You know everything you need to get started. Continue and [create your first app](first-project.md)
